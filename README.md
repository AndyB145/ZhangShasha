ZhangShasha
===========

A Java implementation of the Zhang-Shasha algorithm for tree edit distance.

The original paper describing the algorithm can be found here http://filer.case.edu/axi48/ZhangShasha.pdf .

1. Building trees.
Parenthesized strings such as "f(d(a c(b))e)" which represent trees in preorder can be passed to parseTree() method.

TODO
====

2. Why doesn't the workspace.xml files get ignored by git?
3. I need to learn how to test method properly (maybe do a JUnit tutorial again)...
4. [Top] Refactor the Main class.
5. [Top] Generalize the algorithm. Use Java generics, etc. 
6. [Medium] Write a better README file.
