===========

A Java implementation of the Zhang-Shasha algorithm for tree edit distance.

The original paper describing the algorithm can be found here http://filer.case.edu/axi48/ZhangShasha.pdf .

1. This project includes an easy way to build trees.

TODO
====

1. [LOW] Why doesn't the workspace.xml file get ignored by git? 
2. [HIGH] Generalize the Node class. Use Java generics. 
3. [HIGH] Write a better README file.
4. [HIGH] There might be bugs associated with cost of relabel.
